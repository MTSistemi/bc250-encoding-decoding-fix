# What it catches is the failure that looks like nothing: a library with
# an unresolved symbol. libva reports that not as a missing feature but
# as a driver that will not open at all - "Input/output error", and not a
# word about the symbol unless ffmpeg is asked to be verbose. `ldd -r` is
# the whole reason this file exists.
#
# vainfo cannot stand in for it: without a render node it stops at the
# display long before it opens anything.
